## Challenge 1: No ifs no buts(Toy Problem)
1. Start by defining a function named compare_numbers that takes two arguments, a and b.
2. Initialize an array called comparison with the strings "equal to", "greater than", and "smaller than".
3. Using the <=> operator, compare a and b and get the result of the comparison (0 if equal, 1 if a is greater, and -1 if a is smaller).
4. Add 1 to the result of the comparison and use the result as an index into the comparison array to get the appropriate string.
5. Use string interpolation to construct the final string, which includes the values of a and b as well as the comparison result.
6. Return the final string from the function.
